The password tested in the image scores 100% with a "Very Strong" complexity rating. It includes a good mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and middle characters, fulfilling all strength requirements. It earns positive points for length (10 characters) and character diversity, but small deductions exist for repeated characters and consecutive lowercase and number sequences. Despite minor deductions, the overall strength is excellent, making it highly secure for most uses.

This password scores 19% with a "Very Weak" complexity rating. It lacks important elements like numbers, symbols, sufficient length, and varied character placement. Most of its characters are letters only, and it suffers deductions for consecutive lowercase letters and insufficient diversity. While it includes some uppercase and lowercase letters, it's far from meeting strong password standards. This password is highly vulnerable to attacks and should be improved significantly.
